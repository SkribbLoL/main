# Drawing Service Integration

## ✅ **Integration Complete!**

The drawing service has been successfully integrated into the existing SkribbLoL frontend. Players can now draw collaboratively in real-time during games.

## 🎯 **What's Been Implemented**

### **1. DrawingCanvas Component** (`frontend/src/components/DrawingCanvas.tsx`)
- **Real-time drawing** with Canvas API
- **Pen tools**: Color picker and size slider (1-50px)
- **Permission system**: Only current drawer can draw
- **WebSocket integration** with drawing service
- **Canvas persistence**: Drawings saved and restored
- **Visual feedback**: Clear indicators of who's drawing

### **2. RoomPage Integration** (`frontend/src/pages/RoomPage.tsx`)
- **Seamless integration** into existing room layout
- **Player indicators**: Shows who is currently drawing
- **Game state management**: Canvas appears when game starts
- **Dual socket connections**: Game service + Drawing service

### **3. Configuration** (`frontend/src/config.ts`)
- **Drawing service URL** already configured
- **Environment-aware**: Works in Docker and local development

## 🚀 **How to Use**

### **For Players:**
1. **Join a room** via the frontend: `http://localhost:5173`
2. **Host starts the game** (2+ players required)
3. **Current drawer sees drawing tools**: Color picker, pen size, clear button
4. **Other players see live drawings** in real-time
5. **Everyone can see who's currently drawing** (green indicator)

### **For Testing:**
1. Open **multiple browser tabs** 
2. Join the **same room** with different usernames
3. Host starts the game
4. Watch **real-time collaborative drawing**!
